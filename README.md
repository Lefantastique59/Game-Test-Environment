Basic game test page.
=======================================

This is a basic test setup to quickly test a game in HTML 5 & Javascript.

- Contains an HTML index page as well as as a "base" Javascript script containing basic utility functions like fullscreen & more.

- Also contains a "Game" folder which is meant to contain all the game files.
-> The "Game" folder contains a "main" Javascript script that will act as the main script for your game. An init function is already present to fill in.

A much larger project will be derived from this one in the future.
